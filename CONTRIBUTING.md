# How to Contribute
Hello, welcome to the Prifina Documentation ("Docs") team's contribution template! Please do the following first:
* Review the current open issues [here](https://github.com/prifina/prifina-app-starter/labels/documentation).
* If the documentation errata you encountered hasn't been mentioned, please open a new issue and use the `documentation` label.
* *It is not necessary to self-assign an issue you yourself opened.* **Simply notifying us that there is a problem is a great way to contribute!**
* Check our docs kanban board [here](https://github.com/prifina/prifina-app-starter/projects/1) to see what hasn't been assigned yet.
